## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up and run this project, you'll need the following:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher): [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: Either a local MongoDB instance or a MongoDB Atlas account for cloud-based hosting
- **AWS Account**: For deploying the application on AWS EC2 (optional for local development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abin-online/Cake-Shop-E-Commerce.git
   cd Cake-Shop-E-Commerce
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use `npm` to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000                           # Port on which the app will run
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database   # MongoDB connection string
   SECRETKEY=your-secret-key            # Secret key for session management and JWTs
   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your-razorpay-key    # Razorpay API key for payment processing
   RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your-razorpay-secret   # Razorpay secret key for payment processing
   CLIENT_ID=#####                      # OAuth Client ID (if applicable)
   CLIENT_SECRET=#######                # OAuth Client Secret (if applicable)
   USER_EMAIL=#######                   # Email for system notifications or email service
   USER_PASSWORD=######                 # Password for system email account
   ```

   > You can copy `.env.example` to `.env` if this file is included in the repository.

4. **Start the Application**

   Run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Running with Docker

1. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**

   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start the application and MongoDB services as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Run this command from the root project directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.
